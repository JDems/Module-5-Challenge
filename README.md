Drug Regimen Effectiveness: From the summary statistics and box plots, it's evident that the drug regimens Capomulin and Ramicane tend to result in lower tumor volumes compared to other treatments like Ketapril, Naftisol, and Placebo.
Mouse Weight vs. Tumor Volume: The scatter plot and linear regression analysis show a positive correlation between mouse weight and average tumor volume within the Capomulin regimen. This implies that heavier mice tend to have larger tumor volumes. 
Gender Distribution: The pie chart depicting the distribution of male and female mice in the study shows a relatively balanced gender distribution. This suggests that any observed trends or effects in the data are less likely to be biased by a significant gender imbalance among the mice.

I used Module 5 activities and used a tutor a few weeks ago but I'm finally finishing it now. I used Google and ChatGPT for completing sytax.
